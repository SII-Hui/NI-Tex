# NI-Tex: Non-isometric Image-based Garment Texture Generation

## Overview
![NI-Tex Teaser](asset/Teaser.png)
**NI-Tex** is a cutting-edge framework designed to generate high-quality, physically-based rendering (PBR) textures for garments, regardless of the geometric or topological inconsistencies between input images and 3D garment meshes. It uses advanced data augmentation techniques like *Nano Banana* for topology editing and iterative baking with uncertainty quantification for seamless texture generation. 

Our approach enables high robustness and versatility in producing accurate textures even in challenging scenarios involving strong image-garment mismatches, which are common in 3D garment design applications like virtual try-ons and digital fashion. 🙌🙌🙌
