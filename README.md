# NI-Tex: Non-isometric Image-based Garment Texture Generation

## Overview
![NI-Tex Teaser](asset/Teaser.png)
**NI-Tex** introduces a novel approach to non-isometric garment texture generation by utilizing a physically simulated dataset, 3D Garment Videos, which provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations. The method employs *Nano Banana* for high-quality non-isometric image editing, enabling reliable cross-topology texture generation. Additionally, an iterative baking process guided by uncertainty-driven view selection merges multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. This results in versatile, spatially aligned garment materials, advancing industry-level 3D garment design. 🙌🙌🙌
